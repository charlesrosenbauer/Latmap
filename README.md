This is an extremely experimental data structure to solve an extremely esoteric CS problem.

The problem is this; suppose you have a key-value-pair data structure where the keys are bitsets. Suppose you want to do a lookup along the lines of "find me all the kv pairs whose key is a subset of this lookup value."

This data structure solves that problem.
